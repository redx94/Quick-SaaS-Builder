            The P vs NP problem is one of the most important unsolved problems in computer science and mathematics.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What is P=NP?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            P=NP is a question about whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be solved quickly by a computer.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why is it important?</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>If P=NP is true, it would revolutionize computing and have profound implications for cryptography.</li>
            <li>It would mean that many difficult problems could be solved much more efficiently than we currently can.</li>
            <li>However, most experts believe that Pâ‰ NP, although this hasn't been proven.</li>

            Note: The P=NP problem remains unsolved, and no proof currently exists.
